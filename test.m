%The faces are 36x36 pixels, which works fine as a template size. You could
%add other fields to this struct if you want to modify HoG default
%parameters such as the number of orientations, but that does not help
%performance in our limited test.

%% step 4. (optional) Mine hard negatives
% Mining hard negatives is extra credit. You can get very good performance 
% by using random negatives, so hard negative mining is somewhat
% unnecessary for face detection. If you implement hard negative mining,
% you probably want to modify 'run_detector', run the detector on the
% images in 'non_face_scn_path', and keep all of the features above some
% confidence level.

%% Step 5. Run detector on test set.
% YOU CODE 'run_detector'. Make sure the outputs are properly structured!
% They will be interpreted in Step 6 to evaluate and visualize your
% results. See run_detector.m for more details.
[bboxes, confidences, image_ids] = run_detector(test_scn_path, w, b, feature_params, scale_step, cell_step, confident_thresh);

% run_detector will have (at least) two parameters which can heavily
% influence performance -- how much to rescale each step of your multiscale
% detector, and the threshold for a detection. If your recall rate is low
% and your detector still has high precision at its highest recall point,
% you can improve your average precision by reducing the threshold for a
% positive detection.


%% Step 6. Evaluate and Visualize detections
% These functions require ground truth annotations, and thus can only be
% run on the CMU+MIT face test set. Use visualize_detectoins_by_image_no_gt
% for testing on extra images (it is commented out below).

% Don't modify anything in 'evaluate_detections'!
[gt_ids, gt_bboxes, gt_isclaimed, tp, fp, duplicate_detections] = ...
    evaluate_detections(bboxes, confidences, image_ids, label_path);
